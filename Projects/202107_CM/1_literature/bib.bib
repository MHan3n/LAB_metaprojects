  abstract = {本研究探討廣告的訊息訴求方式、訊息正反性、訊息來源可信度與消費者 認知需求程度等四個變數，對廣告效果的直接影響及交互作用。其中，訊息訴求方式分為理性訴求與感性訴求、訊息正反性分為正面訊息及反面訊息、訊息來源可信度分為高可信度及低可信度、消費者之認知需求則分為高認知需求及低認知需求，前三者以2x2x2的實驗設計操弄，消費者之認知需求由問卷衡量而得，廣告效果則以廣告態度、產品態度、及購買意願衡量之。實驗樣本來自國立成功大學的217位學生。在統計方法上使用了獨立樣本t檢定與雙因子變異數分析來驗證假設。 在直接效果方面，本研究結果指出，訊息來源可信度對廣告效果有直接正 向的影響；正面訊息的廣告對消費者之購買意願的影響會優於反面訊息的廣告；低認知需求的消費者之廣告效果較好。在交互作用方面，本研究結果指出，消費者的認知需求程度不同會干擾訊息訴求方式、訊息正反性、訊息來源可信度對廣告效果的影響關係。高認知需求程度之消費者，較偏好理性訴求的廣告及反面訊息的廣告；而低認知需求之消費者，則偏好感性訴求的廣告與正面訊息的廣告；高可信度的訊息來源對低認知需求者比對高認知需求者更重要。再者，訊息來源可信度分別與訊息訴求方式及訊息正反性，對廣告效果有顯著的交互作用。當高可信度之訊息來源搭配理性訴求，低可信度之訊息來源搭配感性訴求，會產生較佳之廣告效果，又訊息來源可信度為低時，更應配合正面訊息。This study examines the direct and interactive effects of advertising message appeals, message framing, message source credibility, and need for cognition (NFC) of consumers on advertising performance measured by advertising attitude, product attitude and consumers' purchase intention. Message appeals (rational and emotional), message framing (positive and negative), and message source credibility (high and low) are manipulated in a 2x2x2 factorial experiment. Experimental samples are 217 students in National Cheng Kung University. In the statistical method, this study utilizes independent sample t test and two-way ANOVA to test thehypotheses. Regarding the direct effects, the results of this study indicate that message source credibility has positive effect on advertising performance, the positively framed messages result in better purchase intention than negatively framed ones, and low-NFC consumers perceive better advertising performance than high-NFC consumers. Regarding the interactive effects, this study finds that NFC can moderate the effects of message appeals, message framing, and message source credibility on advertising performance. Specifically, while high-NFC consumers prefer the messages of rational appeals and the negatively framed messages, low-NFC consumers respond favorably to the messages of emotional appeals and the positively framed messages, and the message source credibility is more important to low-NFC consumers than high-NFC consumers. Moreover, this study also finds that when message sources with higher credibility present rational messages and message sources with lower credibility present emotional messages, there are more favorable effects on advertising performance. In addition, message sources with lower credibility should present the positively framed messages.},

  abstract = {過去研究已指出個體的性格與其對各類藝術之偏好間有密切關係，其中，開放性是個主要性格因素。張妙清（2002）發展了華人開放性的構念內涵與測量工具，但是此向度與藝術偏好之關聯並不清楚。因此，本文將就張妙清所提出的華人開放性及西方開放性來探討兩者與具象畫及抽象畫偏好之關聯，並進一步探討個體的開放性是否透過認知閉合需求來影響到其畫作偏好。本文以254位台灣地區大學生為對象，所有研究參與者均需填寫跨文化（華人）性格測量表第二版（測量華人開放性）、國際性格題庫（測量西方五項性格向度），以及認知閉合需求量表，並對6幅具象畫與6幅抽象畫（12幅畫作中包括了5幅不同時期的華人畫家的水墨畫作）進行喜歡程度的評定。綜合相關分析、迴歸分析及中介效果分析的結果，研究發現僅有華人開放性對抽象畫偏好有顯著的解釋效果，西方開放性對抽象畫偏好則沒有顯著解釋效果；對具象畫偏好，僅有情緒穩定性有顯著的解釋效果。研究結果進一步發現，華人開放性對抽象畫偏好的解釋效果部分透過認知閉合需求而來。本文針對研究結果特別就抽象畫針對華人開放性可能展現的象徵意義來解釋，並就中國水墨畫的構圖與鑑賞時可能心理歷程做進一步討論。Past studies have shown a clear relationship between personality traits and art preference. Openness to Experience is an especially significant predictor for different kinds of art preference. This relationship has rarely been examined in a Chinese context, and no study has examined Chinese Openness in relation to painting preference. We examined the relationship between Chinese Openness, Western Openness, and painting preference. Chinese Openness consists of personal and interpersonal aspects. The personal aspects of Chinese Openness are similar to those of Western Openness, which reflects openness and imagination in personal intellectual and value domains. However, interpersonal aspects of Chinese Openness reflect social and interpersonal sensitivity and tolerance, which seldom appear in Western Openness. Thus, we investigated the relationship between Chinese and Western Openness and the preference for representative and abstract paintings. We expected that both Chinese and Western Openness would be significantly related to painting preference, especially to abstract paintings. We also investigated the mediating effect of Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC) on the relationship between Openness and painting preference. NCC reflects predictability, preference for order and structure, decisiveness, closed-mindedness, and discomfort with ambiguity. Past studies have revealed that in terms of art preference, people with high NCC like realism (e.g., mannerism) and dislike nonrealism (e.g., surrealism). NCC is a dispositional dimension that is similar to Openness in some ways, but it is more easily influenced by situational characteristics like time limits. Therefore, we expected NCC would be positively related to representative painting preference, but negatively related to abstract painting preference. Furthermore, we expected that NCC would mediate the association between Openness and type of painting preference. We recruited 254 participants (121 women, Mage= 21.6) to complete the measures for Chinese Openness (adapted from the Cross-Cultural Personality Assessment Inventory), Five International Personality Traits, and Need for Cognitive Closure. They also rated their preference for 6 representative paintings and 6 abstract paintings that included Chinese ink paintings and Western oil paintings. The results of the correlational and regression analyses indicated that both Chinese Openness and Intellect/Imagination had a significant positive relationship with a preference for abstract paintings, but NCC had significant negative relationship with this preference. However, Chinese Openness, Intellect/Imagination, and NCC did not have any significant relationship with a preference for representative paintings. Moreover, after controlling the effects of Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Intellect/Imagination, NCC still had a significant mediation effect on the relationships between Chinese Openness and preference for abstract paintings in the mediation analysis, but the same mediation effect was not found in the relationships between Intellect/Imagination and abstract painting preference. Chinese Openness had a significant positive relationship with the preference for abstract painting and this effect was mediated by NCC, but the same effect was not obtained for Western Openness (Intellect/Imagination). It is possible that Chinese Openness, especially the interpersonal aspect, relates to seeking symbolic meaning in paintings and to understanding and tolerating painters' distinctive and individualized ways of seeing the world in paintings. Abstract paintings provide these kinds of opportunities, especially Chinese landscape paintings that combine multiple perspectives to create a conflicting but harmonious aesthetic experience for viewers. People with high Chinese Openness prefer this kind of painting. Another interesting but unexpected finding was that there was no effect of NCC on the preference for representative paintings. It is possible that although NCC is a dispositional dimension, it can also be a state dimension under some conditions, such as when there is no time limit. That is, people may be low in NCC when there is no time limit on rating one's preference for the paintings, so there is no effect evident between NCC and preference for representative paintings. The cultural implications of the relation of Chinese Openness to abstract painting preference and the psychological mechanism underlying appreciation of Chinese landscape paintings are issues to be explored in future research.},

Thus, it is important issue what kinds of factor improve team innovation performance. The purpose of this study is to examine team innovation climate and need for cognitive closure to the relationship between team information sharing and team innovation performance. The study designed a team need for cognitive closure scale and tested its reliability and validity by 174 pre-test subjects from three colleges. In the formal study, the researcher designed two studies. Study one obtained an effective sample of 22 teams with 116 team members altogether form two university. Study two obtained an effective sample of 51 teams with 51 team leaders and 431 team members altogether form fifteen organizations. The result of the two studied showed that the more the team members perceive team innovation climate, the more team information sharing behavior. Furthermore, the more team information sharing behavior, the more team innovation performance. However, only study one proved that the team information sharing mediated the relationship between team innovation climate and team innovation performance. Besides of these, only study one showed that the relationship is negative between the teams’ need for cognitive closure and team information sharing. In addition, team information sharing mediated the relationship between teams’ need for cognitive closure and team innovation performance. Finally, about to the task-orientation diversity, only study two proves that the position background diversity moderate the relationship between the teams’ need for cognitive closure and team information sharing, that is to say, if the teams’ position background diversity is high, the negative relationship between teams’ need for cognitive closure and team information sharing will attenuate.},

  abstract = {Does cognitive motivation influence how people gather and interpret information about COVID-19 and their adherence to measures? To address these questions, we conducted a longitudinal survey among European and American respondents. Wave 1 (N\,=\,501) was conducted on March 27, 2020 and Wave 2 (N\,=\,326) on July 1, 2020. We assessed COVID-19 knowledge, endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, media use, Need for Cognition (NC), Need for Cognitive Closure (NCC), and self-reported adherence to governmental measures taken. Results showed that nearly three-quarters of our respondents actively searched for information about COVID-19. Most at least once a day. Information seeking behaviour was not influenced by cognitive motivation (i.e., NC and NCC). However, cognitive motivation was related to (1) knowledge about COVID-19, (2) conspiracy rejection, and (3) change in knowledge over time. Respondents with more knowledge on COVID-19 also indicated to adhere more often to measures taken by their government. Self-reported adherence to measures was not influenced by cognitive motivation. Implications of these findings will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Food waste is considered to be one of the biggest issues affecting individuals around the globe. The COVID-19 pandemic, with the consequent lockdown processes, has recently triggered individuals to stockpile foodstuffs. Recent data shows, however, that individuals have not consumed a good proportion of the stockpiled food, resulting in increasing amounts of products ending up wasted. Using a cross-national survey conducted in the United States and India, we investigate how individuals' levels of need for cognitive closure (NFC) relate to food stockpiling and waste during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a sequential mediation model, we show how individuals high in NFC did not perceive to have enough food at home, ending up buying more food than usual and, eventually, wasting more. Individuals' gender and country of residence moderate such phenomenon, with the effect being more pronounced among Indian (rather than American) women. We discuss how gender roles in different countries can correlate with the stockpiling and food waste processes. We conclude the manuscript by suggesting how public communication and policy making could develop targeted programs to mitigate such issues.},

In Study 1, a pool of items was administered to 96 faculty members (high-need-for-cognition group) and assembly line workers (low-need-for-cognition group). Ambiguity, irrelevance, and internal consistency were used to select items for subsequent studies. Factor analysis yielded one major factor. In Study 2, the NCS and the Group Embedded Figures Test were administered to 419 undergraduates to validate the factor structure and to determine whether the NCS tapped a construct distinct from test anxiety and cognitive style. The factor structure was replicated, and responses to the NCS were weakly related to cognitive style and unrelated to test anxiety. In Study 3, 104 undergraduates completed the NCS, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and a dogmatism scale. Results indicate that need for cognition was related weakly and negatively to being closeminded, unrelated to social desirability, and positively correlated with general intelligence. Study 4 (97 undergraduates) furnished evidence of the predictive validity of the NCS. (32 ref) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)}

In the present study, we tested how the most important predictors of beliefs in conspiracy theories explain endorsing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 conspiracy theories and conspiracy mentality. Apart from these three measures of conspiratorial thinking, participants (N~=~354) completed several measures of epistemic, existential, and social psychological motives, as well as cognitive processing variables. While many predictors had significant correlations, only three consistently explained conspiratorial beliefs when included in one model: higher spirituality (specifically eco-awareness factor), higher narcissism, and lower analytical thinking. Compared to the other two conspiratorial measures, predictors less explained belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories, but this depended on items' content. We conclude that the same predictors apply to belief in both COVID and non-COVID conspiracies and identify New Age spirituality as an important contributor to such beliefs.},

  abstract = {The Internet is the biggest information carrier of our times. However, there is little understanding of the interaction between the different behaviors of the various Internet users, and the variety of ways in which information in the Internet should be presented. This work continues previous research [Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Kaynar, O., \& Fine, A. (2005). The effects of need for cognition on Internet use. Unpublished manuscript.] that examined the preferences of participants with varying level of Need for Cognition (NFC) [Cacioppo, J. T., \& Petty, R. E. (1982). The need for cognition. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 42, 116–131.] in internet sites varying in their interactivity. This article seeks to broaden the understanding of the behavior of people varying in NFC outside of research situations. We hypothesized that people high in NFC will use information services in the Internet relatively more than those with a low NFC. Furthermore, we hypothesized that people with a high NFC will perceive the informational characteristics of a website as the most important in the creation of a successful and convincing Internet site. Fifty experienced Web surfers filled out an Internet uses questionnaire in which they stated the amount of time they spend per week in 30 different Internet services. This data was later submitted to a Factor Analysis which revealed three major uses: professional, social and leisure. The participants filled out also a preferences questionnaire in which they stated their perceived importance of different characteristics in the creation of a successful and persuasive Internet site. Results support our hypothesis regarding the correlation between NFC and professional services use, and the perceived importance of information in creating a persuasive site. Several other findings are also discussed.},

  abstract = {S. L. Neuberg, T. N. Judice, and S. G. West (1997) faulted our work with the Need for Closure Scale (NFCS) on grounds that the NFCS lacks discriminant validity relative to S. L. Neuberg's and J.T. Newsom's (1993) Personal Need for Structure (PNS) Scale and is multidimensional, which, so they claim, renders the use of its total score inadmissible. By contrast, the present authors show that neither of the above assertions is incompatible with the underlying need for closure theory. Relations between NFCS and the PNS are to be expected, as these were designed to operationalize the very same construct (of need for closure). Furthermore, no unidimensionality of the NFCS has been claimed, and none is required to use its total score for testing various theoretically derived predictions. An instrument's ultimate utility hinges on theoretical considerations and empirical evidence rather than on questionable psychometric dogma unrelated to the substantive matters at hand.

  abstract = {Background With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic surging and new mutations evolving, trust in vaccines is essential. Methods We explored correlates of vaccine hesitancy, considering political believes and psychosocial concepts, conducting a non-probability quota-sampled online survey with 1007 Austrians. Results We identified several important correlates of vaccine hesitancy, ranging from demographics to complex factors such as voting behavior or trust in the government. Among those with hesitancy towards a COVID-19 vaccine, having voted for opposition parties (opp) or not voted (novote) were (95\% Confidence Intervall (CI)opp, 1.44–2.95) to 2.25-times (95\%CInovote, 1.53–3.30) that of having voted for governing parties. Only 46.2\% trusted the Austrian government to provide safe vaccines, and 80.7\% requested independent scientific evaluations regarding vaccine safety to increase willingness to vaccine. Conclusions Contrary to expected, psychosocial dimensions were only weakly correlated with vaccine hesitancy. However, the strong correlation between distrust in the vaccine and distrust in authorities suggests a common cause of disengagement from public discourse.},

  abstract = {Introduces an individual-difference measure of the need for cognitive closure. As a dispositional construct, the need for cognitive closure is presently treated as a latent variable manifested through several different aspects, namely, desire for predictability, preference for order and structure, discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, and close-mindedness. This article presents psychometric work on the measure as well as several validation studies including (1) a "known-groups" discrimination between populations assumed to differ in their need for closure, (2) discriminant and convergent validation with respect to related personality measures, and (3) replication of effects obtained with situational inductions of the need for closure. The present findings suggest that the Need for Closure Scale is a reliable and valid instrument of considerable potential utility in future "motivated social cognition" research.
